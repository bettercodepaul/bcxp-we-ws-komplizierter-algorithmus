The mathematical soundness of this rounding algorithm is based on several key principles:

1. **Error Tracking**
- For each number x, the rounding error e is calculated as: `e = x - round(x)`
- These errors are stored and tracked to make optimal adjustments
- The error will always be in range [-0.5, 0.5]

2. **Sum Preservation Strategy**
```
Given: Original numbers x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ
Let: S = sum(x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ)
Goal: Find integers a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ where:
- round(S) = sum(a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ)
- Each aᵢ is close to xᵢ
```

3. **Minimization of Total Error**
- Initial rounding minimizes local error for each number
- The algorithm then distributes the global error (diff) by:
    - Finding numbers with largest rounding errors
    - Adjusting these numbers first
- This approach minimizes the total squared error: Σ(xᵢ - aᵢ)²

4. **Example with Numbers**
```
Input: [1.2, 2.7, 3.1]
Initial rounding: [1, 3, 3]
Errors: [0.2, -0.3, 0.1]
Original sum: 7.0
Initial rounded sum: 7

Since sums match, no adjustment needed.
Final result: [1, 3, 3]
```

5. **Error Distribution**
- When adjustment is needed, the algorithm picks numbers where:
    - For upward adjustment: highest positive error
    - For downward adjustment: lowest negative error
- This ensures the least deviation from the mathematically correct rounding

This approach is mathematically sound because it:
- Preserves the sum constraint
- Minimizes total rounding error
- Makes adjustments based on quantifiable error metrics
- Produces deterministic results
